I am an eternal student, an enthusiast of functional programming and also of low-level programming, in my spare moments I develop my programming language called `galaxy <https://github.com/galaxy-lang/galaxy>`_, which I did it with some friends. I know a little bit of C/C++ and I study Lisp and Haskell! My github is this: `BrunoCiccarino <https://github.com/BrunoCiccarino/>`_
