<p>Haskell emerged in the mid-1990s, with the aim of being the first purely functional language. For a long time, Haskell was considered an academic language, and therefore difficult, but it is currently used in several companies (in whole or in part of projects), especially fintechs, which are using a lot of haskell.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Before diving into Haskell, you’ll need to set up your development environment. Here’s a quick guide to get started:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Install GHCup</strong>:<br />
GHCup is the recommended way to install Haskell tools like GHC (the Glasgow Haskell Compiler) and Cabal (the Haskell build system). Run the following command in your terminal:</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>   <span class="ex">curl</span> <span class="at">-sSL</span> https://get-ghcup.haskell.org <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="fu">sh</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.</p>
<p>Add GHCup to your PATH:
If not done automatically, add the following line to your shell configuration file (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">export</span> <span class="va">PATH</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="va">$HOME</span><span class="st">/.ghcup/bin:</span><span class="va">$PATH</span><span class="st">&quot;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then reload your shell with source ~/.bashrc or equivalent.</p>
<p>Install GHC and Cabal:
Use GHCup to install the latest versions of GHC and Cabal:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">ghcup</span> install ghc</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">ghcup</span> install cabal</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Verify the installation with:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">ghc</span> <span class="at">--version</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">cabal</span> <span class="at">--version</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Install stack</strong>
The Haskell Stack is a cross-platform program that allows the development of Haskell projects. And to install just type these commands in your terminal (the commands may change depending on your package manager)</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">sudo</span> apt-get install haskell-stack</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Set up an IDE or Editor</strong>:
A good editor makes Haskell development more enjoyable. For a lightweight setup, you can use vim or Neovim with the haskell-language-server. Alternatively, VSCode with the Haskell extension offers a modern IDE experience.</p>
<p>The first thing we’re going to do is run ghc’s interactive mode and call some function to get a basic idea of ​​haskell. Open your terminal and type ghci . You will be greeted with something like this.</p>
<pre><code>$ ghci
GHCi, version 9.4.7: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
ghci&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Now, with the stack we downloaded, create a project by typing</p>
<p>stack new Haskell-notes-for-noobs</p>
<p>simple then it will create the project with the simple template, preparing our environment so that we can learn Haskell in the best way.</p>
<p>It will create a structure similar to this</p>
<pre><code>[03:23 PM]-[charon@DESKTOP-27DNBRN]-[~]- |main U:8 ?:64 ✗|
$ cd Haskell-notes-for-noobs
/home/charon/Haskell-notes-for-noobs

[03:23 PM]-[charon@DESKTOP-27DNBRN]-[~/Haskell-notes-for-noobs]- |main U:8 ?:64 ✗|
$ ls
CHANGELOG.md  Haskell-notes-for-noobs.cabal  LICENSE  README.md  Setup.hs  app  package.yaml  src  stack.yaml  test</code></pre>
<p>This is the folder we will use to do everything in this cookbook, for anyone who wants the codes, all the codes, including the answers to the challenges, they will be in this github repository: <a href="https://github.com/BrunoCiccarino/Haskell-notes-for-noobs">haskell-notes-for-noobs</a></p>
<p>In the era of new languages, in the late 1980s, a team was assembled to develop a purely functional language that would later become haskell, named after mathematician Haskell Brooks Curry.</p>
<p>Haskell with a very rich architecture, a modern, purely functional and non-strict language, specially designed to handle a wide range of applications, from numerical to symbolic. It has an elegant and expressive syntax.</p>
<p>Haskell is specially designed to handle large-scale industrial production applications. It is known for its rich built architecture. Haskell programs are written as mathematical functions. Everything can be done in Haskell, this blog was created in Haskell using the <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">hakyll</a> static page generator, and don’t be scared, it’s actually easier than it looks.</p>
<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>
<p>If you’re the kind of horrible person who doesn’t read the intros to things and skipped, you might be interested in coming back, as I taught you how to prepare your haskell development environment. In haskell everything is done with function calls, hence the name functional statically, implicitly typed (the types are checked by the compiler, but you don’t need to declare them), lazy (nothing is done until it needs to be done). Its closest popular relative is probably the ML family of languages ​​(which are not, however, lazy languages).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Laziness by default is a very unusual language design. By default, Haskell evaluates something only when it is necessary. As a result, it provides a very elegant way of manipulating infinite structures, for example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, now we can make some basic expressions in Haskell so you can get the hang of it.</p>
<h4 id="simple-expressions">Simple expressions</h4>
<p>You can type most math expressions directly into ghci and get an answer.</p>
<pre><code>$ ghci
GHCi, version 9.4.7: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
ghci&gt;  3 * 5
15
ghci&gt; 4 ^ 2 - 1
15
ghci&gt; (1 - 5)^(3 * 2 - 4)
16
ghci&gt;</code></pre>
<p>For strings, it must be enclosed in “double quotes”. And to concatenate them use the ++ operator.</p>
<pre><code>ghci&gt; &quot;Hi dear&quot;
&quot;Hi dear&quot;
ghci&gt; &quot;Hello&quot; ++ &quot;World&quot;
&quot;HelloWorld&quot;</code></pre>
<p>To call functions, simply place the arguments directly after the function. There are no parentheses as part of the function call:</p>
<pre><code>ghci&gt; gcd 21 14
7
ghci&gt; round 6.59
7
ghci&gt; not (5 &lt; 3)
True
ghci&gt; truncate 6.59
6
ghci&gt; sqrt 2
1.4142135623730951</code></pre>
<p><strong>Challenge</strong>
- In the Haskell repl (read eval print loop) determine the value of each of the powers below.</p>
<ul>
<li><ol type="a">
<li>25^1</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" type="a">
<li>150^0</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="3" type="a">
<li>(7/9)^-2</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="hello-world">Hello world</h4>
<p>I/O can be used to read and write to the console, to print something on the screen we use putStrLn, putStr or print as in the example below.</p>
<pre><code>ghci&gt; putStrLn &quot;Hello, dear&quot;
Hello, dear
ghci&gt; putStr &quot;no line break&quot;
no line breakghci&gt; print (10 + 10)
20
ghci&gt; print ( 1 &gt; 2)
False</code></pre>
<p>Reading can be done with getLine (which returns a String) or readLn (which returns any type of value you want). The&lt;-O symbol is used to assign a name to the result of an I/O action.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>main <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="kw">do</span></span>

<h4 id="high-order-function">High order function</h4>
<p>In haskell functions can receive functions as parameters, allowing the creation of generic functions, composing two or more functions and defining specific domain languages. Higher-order functions are not just a part of the Haskell experience, they are practically the Haskell experience. It turns out that if you want to define computations by defining what things are rather than defining steps that change some state and perhaps looping them, higher order functions are indispensable. They are a really powerful way of solving problems and thinking about programs.</p>
<p>Officially, each function in Haskell only accepts one parameter. So how is it possible that we have defined and used multiple functions that accept more than one parameter so far? Well, it’s a clever trick! All functions that accepted multiple parameters so far have been curried functions. What does this mean? You will understand better with an example. Let’s take our good friend, the max function. It appears that it accepts two parameters and returns the larger one. Doing max 7 8 first creates a function that accepts a parameter and returns 7 or that parameter, depending on which is greater. Then 8 is applied to that function and that function produces the desired result. It sounds like a mouthful, but it’s actually a really cool concept. The following two calls are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>ghci&gt; max 7 8
8
ghci&gt; (max 7) 8
8</code></pre>
<p>Putting a space between two things is simply function application. Space is like an operator and has the highest precedence. Let’s look at the type of max. It’s max :: (Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a. This can also be written as max :: (Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; (a -&gt; a). This can be read as: max takes an a and returns (this is the -&gt;) a function that takes an a and returns an a. This is why the return type and function parameters are all simply separated with arrows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The operator =&gt; in Haskell: This operator separates the constraints (on type variables) from the rest of the type signature. For instance, in max :: (Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a, the Ord a constraint indicates that the type a must belong to the Ord type class, which means it supports ordering operations like &lt;, &gt;, and compare. The part after the =&gt; describes the actual function signature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how is this beneficial for us? Simply put, if we call a function with few parameters, we get back a partially applied function, that is, a function that takes in as many parameters as we left out. Using partial application (calling functions with few parameters, if you prefer) is a cool way to create functions on the fly so we can pass them to another function or seed them with some data.</p>
<p>Take a look at this offensively simple function:</p>
<pre><code>addThree :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int
addThree x y z = x + y + z</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>ghci&gt; :l addThree.hs
[1 of 2] Compiling Main             ( addThree.hs, interpreted )
Ok, one module loaded.
ghci&gt; addTwoMore = addThree 5
ghci&gt; result = addTwoMore 10 15
ghci&gt; print(result)
30</code></pre>
